I picked the dog I wanted in the same way I picked a favorite Pok√©mon. I looked in the classified section next to the automotive ads and found a breed named "Peekapoo," which was close enough to "Pikachu."

No one ever tells you that begging for a dog as an 11-year-old could affect you deeply as an adult. They just make you promise to clean up after the animal.

But when Rainbow was 10, my parents moved abroad, and she came to live with me in New York. At first, she couldn't figure out how to pee on concrete; she cried a lot, so I cried a lot. Eventually we learned how to communicate, even as she lost her vision, her hearing, her continence.

Last week, I had to put her down.

No one ever tells you that when your dog is dying, it feels like a human is dying. At first, I tried to suppress the grief. But so many other dog owners said things like, "It felt like a family member had died." As a data person, all I could see was a growing sample size.

So instead of mourning --- or maybe _this_ was my mourning --- I sat next to Rainbow during her final days, and I read research papers and books about humans' relationship with dogs.

As it turns out, we really are two species with an odd, symbiotic relationship.

It turns out there's a reason it feels like a human has died.

### **This is how dogs helped us become who we are today**

The relationship began as early as [33,000 years ago][1]. Scholars think we probably hunted together and lingered around each other, because wolves were a lot like humans --- both social creatures, [willing to work together][2] to accomplish tasks.

Some go as far as to say that [this alliance is what helped humans survive][3], while the Neanderthals didn't.

When humans migrated to Europe, we had to compete with large carnivores and Neanderthals for big game, like elk and bison. Some scholars believe that humans came out on top because we partnered with wolves. The wolves chased the large animals until they were tired out, and since it was dangerous for them to get too close to a larger animal, humans used sharp weapons go in for the final kill.

Then they split the meat.

In short, this partnership helped created the modern dog --- and the modern human.

### **This is how dogs went from partner to worker to friend**

About 320 years ago, an English farmer had a dog named Quon. He was probably a working dog, like most dogs of that time. So when the animal outlived his usefulness, [the farmer wrote][4] in his journal, "My dog Quon was killed and baked for his grease, of which he yielded 11lb."

It's gruesome, but it illustrates just how new the idea of a pet is. Only [500 years ago][5] did we started using the word "pet" to describe a dependent, nonworking animal, and even then it wasn't used to describe dogs. Rather, it described orphan lambs that had to be raised by hand.

But the Western world started warming to the idea of companion animals. Keith Thomas, in his influential book _[Man and the Natural World][6]_, argues that we eventually let animals into our homes, we gave them names, and we never, ever ate them.

It got to the point that about 200 years ago, the [modern pet industry began to develop][5]; there was an explosion of pet shops, pet supplies, pet food, and even children's books about pets.

About 100 years ago, purebred dogs started [becoming popular][5], and more vets began specializing in small species because they were no longer stigmatized for choosing to care for companion animals.

Now, in the present day, [60 percent of Americans][7] own a pet.

This evolution may be tied to [the way we started to think about defenseless humans][8], like children, the elderly, the chronically ill, and the poor. Historian Katherine Grier writes, "It's connected to changing ideas about human nature, emotional life, individual responsibility, and our society's obligations to all kinds of dependent others, including people."

But with dogs, that relationship has clearly taken a deeper turn than, say, our relationship with the elderly neighbor down the street.

These were very recently working animals, but now [half of all pet owners][9] feel their pet is as much a part of the family as any other person in their household. A third let their pets sleep on the bed.

A few years ago, researchers asked dog owners about [a hypothetical scenario][10]: If there were a runaway bus speeding toward a person and your dog, which one would you save? About 40 percent said they would save their dog over a foreign tourist.

### **This is why dogs are like humans --- or (sometimes) better!**

In order to understand our current relationships with dogs, we have to understand our relationships with other humans.

It all goes back to this thing called ["attachment theory,"][11] which posits that humans have a biological tendency to form attachments for survival reasons. At first this is usually with mothers, but later it can be with friends and romantic partners.

Now scholars are seeing this type of attachment with pets, specifically dogs.

In 2000, researchers found that [dogs offered more support][12] than humans in three ways:

1. Providing a reliable and lasting relationship
2. Being a better receiver of care
3. Being a better source of companionship

In 2008, researchers found that pets [offer a unique type of relationship][13], cushioning the "uncertainty of more complex relationships with humans."
